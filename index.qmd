Hello! 
I am a fourth year Quantitative Marketing Ph.D. candidate at the University of Toronto. 
I hold an MA in Economics from the University of British Columbia. 

My research revolves around causal inference, industrial organization, and 
geospatial marketing. I also like to write about sports analytics, 
data visualization, and using R to simplify everyday challenges. 

Feel free to have a look around!
