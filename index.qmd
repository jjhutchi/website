Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management specializing in 
Quantitative Marketing. Previously I attended the Vancouver School of Economics where 
I completed my Master's degree in Economics. Additionally, I worked as a pre-doctoral 
researcher for professors [Matt Lowe](https://mattlowe.site/) and 
[Patrick Baylis](https://www.patrickbaylis.com/) at the 
[Center for Innovative Data in Economics Research](https://economics.ubc.ca/cider/research-activity/) 
at the University of British Columbia. 

I like to write blog posts on different topics including sports analytics, data visualization, 
and using R to help in everyday life. 

This website is a place where I like to post some of the work I am up to. Feel free 
to have a look around.
