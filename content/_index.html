<p>Hello! I am a Ph.D.Â Candidate at the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management
specializing in <a href="https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/Degrees/PhD/Academics/MajorAreasofStudy/Marketing">Quantitative Marketing</a>. Previously I attended the Vancouver
School of Economics where I completed a Masters degree in Economics. Additionally,
I worked as a Pre-Doctoral Researcher for Professors
<a href="https://mattlowe.site/">Matt Lowe</a> and
<a href="https://www.patrickbaylis.com/">Patrick Baylis</a> at the <a href="https://economics.ubc.ca/cider/research-activity/">Center for Innovative Data in Economics Research</a> at the Vancouver School of Economics.</p>
<!-- My areas of interest are consumer choice, behavioural economics, and mechanism design. -->
<p>I like to write blog posts on different topics including Sports Analytics,
Data Visualization, and using R to help in your every day life.</p>
<p>This website is a place where I like to post some of the work I am up to.
Feel free to have a look around.</p>
