Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management 
specializing in [Quantitative Marketing](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/Degrees/PhD/Academics/MajorAreasofStudy/Marketing). Previously I attended the Vancouver 
School of Economics where I completed a Masters degree in Economics. Additionally, 
I worked as a Pre-Doctoral Researcher for Professors 
[Matt Lowe](https://mattlowe.site/) and 
[Patrick Baylis](https://www.patrickbaylis.com/) at the [Center for Innovative Data in Economics Research](https://economics.ubc.ca/cider/research-activity/) at the Vancouver School of Economics. 

<!-- My areas of interest are consumer choice, behavioural economics, and mechanism design. -->

I like to write blog posts on different topics including Sports Analytics,
Data Visualization, and using R to help in your every day life. 

This website is a place where I like to post some of the work I am up to. 
Feel free to have a look around.
